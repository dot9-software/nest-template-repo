These are all entities for the Transportschule project. An Entity is a class that maps to a database table: https://typeorm.io/#/entities.

Understanding each Entity's meaning and purpose is essential to understanding anything in the project, as all functionalities are operations on / involving entities.

**Each Entity is thus documented directly in its `*.entity.ts` file**
